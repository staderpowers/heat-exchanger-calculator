Heat Exchanger Area Calculator (Excel Tool)

This project provides an Excel-based calculator for estimating the required heat exchanger area using the Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD) method. The user inputs inlet/outlet temperatures, heat duty, and overall heat transfer coefficient. Excel computes ΔT₁, ΔT₂, LMTD, and required area (A).

Equations Used

ΔT₁ = Th_in – Tc_out
ΔT₂ = Th_out – Tc_in
LMTD = (ΔT₁ – ΔT₂) / ln(ΔT₁ / ΔT₂)
A = Q / (U × LMTD)
